1,Jun 4 2024,Embracing Strengths: A Path to Self-Discovery and Empowerment,"Ran into Jay at Accenture.  He said “interesting work? I was searching but I gave up long ago. It’s not very realistic to pursue those.” consulting is a sunsetting industry. All the possibilities are open for him - promotion, layoff. Everything is uncertain. 

I feel like a lot of us spend too much time on what we think we *should* do. we don’t spend time on learning about what we are good at or enjoy. this increases the likelihood of experiencing repeated failures, then losing the conviction that we can achieve something. learned helplessness. 

It is important that we give ourselves chance to learn about what we already enjoy and good at. from this we  expand the circle of competency (self-efficacy → self-esteem). This does not mean that we go all in on our strength. the idea is that we have a certain level of confidence and conviction in themselves, this helps when working on to improve on our weakness (what they should do). 

Meeting justin & starting martial arts was this kind of moment in my life. I learned how to stretch my ability in this way, and from that, I got more confidence.  Martial arts state of mind. I would love to share with others. Learn to be okay with confrontation. Being okay with pressure. stay focused and look for an opportunity to come back."
2,"Apr 1, 2024",Unveiling Self-Truth: Embracing Growth and Resisting Judgment,"on Muy Thai. I thought didn’t like sparring because I think aggression/violence is bad. But once I start winning, I like sparring.  Nietzsche’s take on ‘truth’ is in fact will to power. that I made moral attribution. but in fact it was because I wasn’t good at it. When I become good at it, I like it. When I am not good at it, I don’t like it. in the end, it was my own rationalization to feel good about myself (state of being - when I am bad at it, I can just say aggression is bad). Solution: don’t judge until you are at the position to judge."
3,"Mar 15, 2024",Humility in Exploration: Navigating New Ideas with Caution and Awareness,"Shiny object syndrome. Something seems super simple but when looking into it there are a lot of nuance. watch out for the blind spot. you think you can do it because it looks easy. When you are new, you don’t any experiences to challenge your understanding of the subject, then it’s very easy to assume that you are correct about everything and you are exceptional at the subject. Because you think you know it 

you want it because you think it is a good idea. not good. Everybody can come with 100 reasons why they are correct. No one can come up with reason why they are wrong about it. Because it’s  blind spot. 

Solution: Be aware of this tendency. Aware that when something is new, you need huge buffer to (it would be harder /be more cautious when exploring new ideas)"
4,"Nov 1, 2023",Embracing Authenticity: Cultivating Confidence Beyond External Validation,"Kyle does not follow me back, while he followed Sammie. I felt shame and think it’s because he thinks I am an empty shell . What I said during the coaching session might sound like just amateur and beginner, who doesn’t know what she is talking about. And this value attribution error. I tend to connect immediately what I fear as how I am perceived by others as opposed to just taking it what it is. "
5,"Nov 8, 2023",Prioritizing Authenticity: Valuing Fulfillment Over External Expectations,"I felt annoyed when mom suggested that I go back to public policy or work for an embassy. I think I have this strong idea of what I don’t want to be.  I am afraid of other people judging me. Sophie is not as good as I thought she was.I wanted to live up to the expectation  or the perception that other people hold about myself.  

What hurt me the most is that I interpret her concern as mistrusting of my ability or undermine my ability. I know it is just a career but I don’t want to go home feeling empty.  But also, at the end of a day,  it is just work. I want to go back home, where my family is. I am not chasing glories and money. I should never let go of my priority in the name of tool (money) that is supposed to get me to my priority."
6,"Dec 1, 2023",Embracing Imperfection: Choosing Action Over Perfection,"Perfectionist ( looking for the right project) → look for the perfect opportunities. frustration not finding the right project (looking for the one, or perfect one, instead of accepting that there is no perfect company. we all have  blind spots, flaws, and areas of improvement). tunnel visioned a lot. 
sometimes sub optimal choice is better than nothing. I should just pick. "
7,"Oct 1, 2023",Efficiency Through Sequence: Prioritizing Focus in Coding Problem-Solving,"coding. Get distracted easily when I found a problem (ie Tag Id not being sent) and side problem (temp solution of showing all tags), I try to solve all problems at once. Instead of finishing one off.  Unless there is a dependency or priority issue, I should stick to solving one small problem. Do it sequentially instead of solving things at one go
"
8,"Oct 15, 2023",Mindful Mastery: Prioritizing Understanding Over Quick Fixes in Coding,"Coding. Frustrated because I am not managing to figure out things that I want. When I am frustrated, I brute force. Even though quality I need to practice is explain the expected behavior or check my understanding step by step.  Very difficult to reason why I “feel fed up”.  It’s the balance between need to finish and need to understand to solve. Higher reasoning. Because I value understanding. Focus on understanding the components that are affecting my expected results.  watch out tendency to brute force "
9,"Oct 16, 2023",Strategic Focus: Prioritizing Essentials Over Distractions in Task Management,"Frustrated. spent how many hours!! Smaller ui logics or ui details may change. Focus on getting main data first. watch out tendency to find the most recent problem as most important problem, and forego the main issue. watch out tendency to be sidetracked (shiny object syndrome/recency bias). found the most recent problem as the important problem "
