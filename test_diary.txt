Ran into Jay at Accenture.  He said “interesting work? I was searching but I gave up long ago. It’s not very realistic to pursue those.” consulting is a sunsetting industry. All the possibilities are open for him - promotion, layoff. Everything is uncertain.
I feel like a lot of us spend too much time on what we think we *should* do. we don’t spend time on learning about what we are good at or enjoy. this increases the likelihood of experiencing repeated failures, then losing the conviction that we can achieve something. learned helplessness.
It is important that we give ourselves chance to learn about what we already enjoy and good at. from this we  expand the circle of competency (self-efficacy → self-esteem). This does not mean that we go all in on our strength. the idea is that we have a certain level of confidence and conviction in themselves, this helps when working on to improve on our weakness (what they should do).
Meeting justin & starting martial arts was this kind of moment in my life. I learned how to stretch my ability in this way, and from that, I got more confidence.  Martial arts state of mind. I would love to share with others. Learn to be okay with confrontation. Being okay with pressure. stay focused and look for an opportunity to come back.
